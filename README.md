# RecyclerViewDemo
**Sample Code for Lesson 10 RecyclerView**

This repo is a sample code shown in classroom to study RecyclerView within Android Development.
It corresponds to Lesson 10 "Advanced RecyclerView use cases" of the module "Multimedia and Mobile Devices Programming".
We've developed an app that lists integer numbers from 0 to 100 (and its correspondence binaries).

In the first commit, we've developed the solution using a basic RecyclerView with its adapater (seen in Lesson 5). 

In the second commit, we've added Data Binding to handle UI.

In the third commit, we've replaced adapter with ListAdapter to optimize performance.

In the fourth commit, we've added Binding Adapter to generate and display binary correspondence of integer numbers.

In the sixth and seventh commit, we've replaced LinearLayoutManager with GridLayoutManager and played with its span size.

In the eighth commit, we've added clickListeners to items to toast its value.
